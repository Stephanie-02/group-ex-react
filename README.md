# Getting started:

Inside the repository.

This will start your react app.
React app will run on **localhost:3000**.

## Start editing the **src/app.jsx** file.
- Add a new component called Students.jsx, add it to the routes in App.jsx, as the route "/students". Add a link to navigate to that component.
- Create a StudentDetails form in Students.jsx, that has three input tags for name, age and year. Give a name to each input tag, which we will use together with the form ref.
- Attach a ref to this form.
- Create a button called "Add Student", that will add all these details from the inputs into a list of students, that's a state variable.
- Use .map() to display the list of students on the screen, with their properites like name, age, etc, in p or div tags.
- Add a button to Delete a student from the list of students. Use the student's "index" in order to delete them from the list.
